### ✍️

<blockquote>
I asked the ocean<br>
You are giant and majestic<br>
You live on for epochs<br>
Maybe you are just there, a characteristic<br>
The greatest of men drowns in your magnificence<br>
Your glory was told before I came to be<br>
Your glory shall be told until the last of humans breathe<br>
I sometimes wanna trade shoes with you<br>
But you don't have any sentience<br>

<br>

The ocean said,<br>
Oh mighty human<br>
You are me and I am you<br>
You and I both were always there and shall continue to be<br>
You cherish sentience, the sentience that gave you an unquenchable, unsatiable, and all-consuming hunger<br>
Is this really sentience or a mirage? A mirage of a lustrous oasis.<br>
You, a traveler with hopes, chase this mirage, condemned to crave to no avail<br>
That's your sentience, oh mighty human 

<br>

I was perplexed, I asked the ocean<br>
My sentiments are flaring, who will write this poem if not for this intensity of emotions?<br>
A convergence of polar extremes, ceaseless cravings, and boundless suffering<br>
These are inevitable parts of the human experience, our sentience. Oh ocean, for you what else is there but stillness?<br>
Oh ocean, are you capable of loving as intensely as me?<br>
Can you get mesmerized by the everyday ordinary?<br>
What's the charm of this stillness?
